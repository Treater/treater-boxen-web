### Boxen Project Info
Boxen is our **IT DevOps Robot**. It's primary directive is to automate every piece of our development environment.  GitHub, Inc. wrote the first version of Boxen (imaginatively called “The Setup”) to help employees start shipping on day one.  It's configuration management for everyone: Designers, HR mavens, legal eagles, and developers.  A belief that development is production, we value consistency, predictability, and reproducibility over artisanal, hand-tweaked development environments.  With this mentatlity we can more quickly spin up new projects dependant on other technologies accross all of our machines and issue updates.  To learn more check out http://boxen.github.com/.
